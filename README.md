The Football Team Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of football teams and players. It offers a range of features for creating, updating, and viewing player and team information. Built with Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL, the system ensures robustness, scalability, and reliability. Postman is utilized for endpoint testing to validate the functionality of API endpoints.

3. Technologies Used:

Java Spring Boot: Backend development framework.
Hibernate: Object-relational mapping tool for data persistence.
PostgreSQL: Relational database management system.
Postman: Endpoint testing tool.
4. System Architecture:

The system follows a microservice architecture comprising separate services for player management, team management, relationship management, and data retrieval. Communication between services is facilitated through HTTP requests or messaging protocols like AMQP.

5. Database Schema:

Players Table:

player_id (PK)
name
age
position
nationality
team_id (FK, nullable)
dominant_foot
Teams Table:

team_id (PK)
name
coach
founded_year
logo_url
6. Endpoints:

7. Future Enhancements:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure access.
Add validation for input data to ensure data integrity.
Enhance frontend interface for better user experience.
Incorporate additional features such as match scheduling, statistics tracking, etc.
8. Microservice Architecture:

The system is designed using a microservice architecture, with each microservice responsible for specific functionalities:

Player Service: Manages player-related operations.
Team Service: Manages team-related operations.
Relationship Service: Manages the relationship between players and teams.
Data Service: Handles data retrieval operations.
Microservices communicate with each other via HTTP requests or messaging protocols, ensuring modularity and scalability.

9. Conclusion:

The Football Team Management System offers a comprehensive solution for managing football teams and players efficiently. With its microservice architecture, robust technologies, and well-defined features, it aims to simplify the process of organizing and managing football teams effectively.
